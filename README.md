# Description

This is a fork from Derfuu_ComfyUI_ModdedNodes. You can find the original repo from [LINK](https://github.com/Derfuu/Derfuu_ComfyUI_ModdedNodes) .

I've made a few modifications to accommodate my own usage habits.

# Modifications

  - sum: the input type changed to int+int from float+float, the output type changed to int from float.
  - sub: the input type changed to int-int from float-float, the output type changed to int from float.
